# Insertion sorts
> got to sort that data

## Challenge
> Write a function for insertion sort that takes in an unsorted array and returns the array sorted using insertion sort.

## Approach and Efficiency
### To Be Added
```
	A binary tree is unordered so to find a value the whole tree may need to be searched.
	Recursion is used to go traverse through the tree. This results in:

	Time: O(N)
	Space: O(H), where H is the height of the tree
```
