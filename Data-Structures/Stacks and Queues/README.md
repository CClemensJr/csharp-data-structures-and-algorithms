# Stacks and Queues
<A stacks and queues are data structures used to sift through data

## Challenge
```
Wrote an application that implements both a Stack data structure and a Queue;
```

## Approach and Efficiency
```
For this implementation I used methods that take a node and put them inside the queue or stack as well as methods that remove nodes from the stack or queue. No iteration is used and only a single temporary node created.

Big O: O(1)
```

## API
### Stack
```
Within the Stack implementation I created 3 methods: Push, Pop, and Peek. 

Push takes a node and puts it into the stack.

Pop removes the node on the top of the stack.

Peek returns the node on top of the stack.

```
### Queue
```
Within the Queue implementation I created 3 methods: Enqueue, Dequeue, and Peek;

Enqueue takes a node and puts it into the queue.

Dequeue removes the front node from the queue.

Peek returns the node at the front of the queue
```
