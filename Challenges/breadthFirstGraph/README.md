# Breadth-First Traversal of a Graph

## Challenge
> Implement a breadth-first traversal on a graph.

## Example
|Input|Output|
|-----|-------|
| 1 | [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] |

## Approach and Efficiency
```
	For this problem I decided to use a while loop over the entire graph 
	with a nested for loop to compare the children of each node.

	Big O: Time: O(n^2), Space: O(w)
```
