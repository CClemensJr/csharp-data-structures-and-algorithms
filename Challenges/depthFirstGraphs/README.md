# Depth-First Traversal of a Graph
> Conduct a depth first preorder traversal on a graph

## Challenge
> Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. Return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.

## Approach and Efficiency
```
	For this problem I decided to use recursion traverse over the entire graph. 

	Big O: Time: O(n), Space: O(h)
```
