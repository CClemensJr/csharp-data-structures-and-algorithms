# Determine If All Characters in a String are Unique

## Challenge
```
	Implement a method with the following signature bool AreCharactersUnique(string input)
	that returns true if all the characters in the string are unique.
```

## Example
|Input|Output|
|-----|-------|
| string | true |
| strings | false |


## Approach and Efficiency
```
	For this problem I decided to nested for loops to compare each character in the string
	to each other character in the string.

	Big O: Time: O(n^2), Space: O(1)
```
