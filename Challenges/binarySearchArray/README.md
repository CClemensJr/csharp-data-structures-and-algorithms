# Search through an Array with the Binary Search Algorithm

## Challenge
```
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.
```

##Example
|Input|	Output|
|-----|-------|
| [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42], 15 | 2 |
| [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77], 90 | -1 |

##Approach and Efficiency
```
I will place Big O notation details here.
